# LSTM_ASCEND
☑️Trains an LSTM model on past subject + staircase parameters and corresponding joint Range of Motion (ROM) values.

☑️Takes new inputs from the user (subject measurements + staircase dimensions).

☑️Predicts the hip, knee, and ankle ROM.

☑️Visualizes the results in real time using a live bar chart.

📥 Inputs

There are two types of inputs:

1️⃣ Training Inputs (from Excel file X_data.xlsx)
   
Each row is a data sample:

Subject Height (cm)

Subject Speed (m/s)

Knee Length (cm)

Staircase Tread (cm)

Staircase Riser (cm)

These are predicted based on the input subject + stair features.

2️⃣ Live Visualization
   
The predicted ROMs are shown in a bar chart, with:

Y-axis: Range of Motion (degrees, scaled 1–10)

Bars: Hip ROM, Knee ROM, Ankle ROM
