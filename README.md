# LSTM_ASCEND
☑️Trains an LSTM model on past subject + staircase parameters and corresponding joint Range of Motion (ROM) values.

☑️Takes new inputs from the user (subject measurements + staircase dimensions).

☑️Predicts the hip, knee, and ankle ROM.

☑️Visualizes the results in real time using a live bar chart.
